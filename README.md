# Lego Boost Browser Application

Control Lego Boost from the browser without any installations.

Uses [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API). Works with most computers (__Windows, Mac, Linux__) and __Android__ devices with __Chrome__ and __Opera__ browsers. Unfortunately Apple iOS doesn't support Web Bluetooth. 

### Problems

Known bluetooth problems with:
* Microsoft Surface Book 2
* ...

If connection doesn't work, test connection to Lego Boost with [Google's sample tester](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/web-bluetooth/read-characteristic-value-changed.html).

#### Docker

For easier deployment.
